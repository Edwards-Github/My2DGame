# Java 2D Game Project (Work In Progress)
This repository contains a Java 2D game project that I've been working on, inspired by a tutorial from Ryisnow on YouTube. Please note that this project is a work in progress, and I'm sharing it to keep my GitHub account active and to potentially inspire others who are interested in game development.

## Project Overview
This Java 2D game project is aimed at helping me learn game development using Java. I followed along with the tutorial by Ryisnow to create this game. While the code is not yet finished, I've decided to share it here as a way to track my progress and share what I've learned.

## Getting Started
To run this game on your local machine, you will need:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from Oracle or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any Java-compatible IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

3. Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/Edwards-Github/My2DGame.git`

4. Open the Project: Open the project in your chosen IDE.

5. Run the Game: Run the game's main class to start the game. Please note that since this is a work in progress, there may be incomplete or buggy features.
