# Java 2D Game Project (Work In Progress)
This repository showcases a Java 2D game project inspired by a tutorial by Ryisnow on YouTube. While the project is still a work in progress, I’m sharing it to keep my GitHub active and to encourage others interested in game development to explore and learn.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of game development using Java. By following Ryisnow’s tutorial, I’ve been able to create and expand on this game. Although the code is incomplete, sharing it here allows me to document my progress and demonstrate what I’ve learned so far.

## Getting Started
To run this game on your local machine, you will need:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from Oracle or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any Java-compatible IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

3. Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
```
    git clone https://github.com/Edwards-Github/My2DGame.git
```

4. Open the Project: Open the project in your chosen IDE.

5. Run the Game: Run the game's main class to start the game. Please note that since this is a work in progress, there may be incomplete or buggy features.

## Acknowledgments
A heartfelt thank-you to Ryisnow for the tutorial that inspired this project. Learning from others is an invaluable part of growth as a developer, and I hope this project serves as a source of inspiration for others embarking on their game development journey.
